<p>  	In this lecture, we&#039;re going to build a todo list application from scratch. This is the most fun part of this course. You&#039;ll see the concepts you&#039;ve learned in the previous sections all tied together. I&#039;ll share with you a lot of tips and best practices along the way.  </p>  <p>  	We&#039;re going to build this app in an iterative, agile way. In each iteration, we enhance the application a little bit. By the end of this section, we&#039;ll have a fully working todo list app with a RESTful API for persistence.  </p>  <p>  	Note that each lecture includes the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; source code in the supplementary materials. It&#039;s best if you watch a lecture first to see what happens first, then take the &quot;before&quot; source code, play the lecture again and code along with me. This way you know where we&#039;ll be heading to and your mind is already familiar with the techniques. By coding along with me, you&#039;ll reinforce the materials.  </p>  <p>  	Make sure to watch this section to the end as it&#039;s the most valuable part of this course.  </p>  <p>  	Allt the best!  </p>
