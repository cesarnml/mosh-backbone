<p>  	If you have made it this far, congratulations! You are one of the minority who is passionate and committed enough to finish this course.  </p>  <p>  	I hope you have benefited from the materials in this course. If you&#039;ve been happy, I&#039;d really appreciate if you take a minute and leave a review for me. If you have not been happy, please tell me how I can improve the course. I wanna provide the best learning experience for you and other programmers like you.  </p>  <p>  	Now, what&#039;s next? Well, Backbone is pretty much what you have learned in this course. There are few tiny details that you&#039;ll hardly ever use. But you can look at backbonejs.org and read through the documentation if you&#039;re keen. What I&#039;ve covered in this course covers more than 90% of what you find in the documentation. You&#039;ve got all the essential tools to build applications with Backbone. If you still have difficulty writing an application with Backbone, I suggest you get back to the exercises in each section and make sure to complete them. I personally have used the same materials here to build many applications with Backbone without any difficulties.  </p>  <p>  	The only other think you may want to learn (optionally) is a plug-in for Backbone called Backbone Relational. There are several (unofficial) plug-ins written for Backbone and it&#039;s not possible for me to cover them in this course. After all, this course is about Backbone, and not the third-party plug-ins that come out every day. So, I leave that to you to research and find any plug-ins that you may find useful in your projects. But remember, Backbone by itself is enough to build clean, maintainable, and testable applications. You do NOT need any of these plug-ins. The only plug-in I have personally used and benefitted is Backbone Relational.  Check out their documentation to learn more about it:  </p>  <p>  	<a href="http://www.backbonerelational.org/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow" style="" class="external-link">www.backbonerelational.org</a>  </p>  <p>  	Again, I would like to congratulate you for investing your time and energy and completing this course. I&#039;d really appreciate if you take a minute and leave a review for my course.  </p>  <p>  	Mosh  </p>
